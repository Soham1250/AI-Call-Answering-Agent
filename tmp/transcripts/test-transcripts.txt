[USER 00:00] Hello, this is Rajesh calling from Zenith Imports. Am I speaking with Imperial X?

[ASSISTANT 00:03] Yes, good afternoon Rajesh. This is Imperial X. How are you doing?

[USER 00:06] I’m doing well, thank you. I wanted to discuss the distribution deal we touched upon last week. Do you have a few minutes?

[ASSISTANT 00:13] Absolutely, I have time. Please go ahead.

[USER 00:15] Great. So, as you know, we’ve been looking for a reliable partner in Bangalore to handle the distribution of our electronic accessories—chargers, cables, adapters, things like that. We’ve reviewed your company profile, and it seems like you have the retail network we need.

[ASSISTANT 00:31] Yes, we do cover about 120 outlets across Bangalore and Mysore, plus we have online tie-ups. Could you give me an idea of the volume you’re expecting?

[USER 00:40] Sure. In the first quarter, we anticipate moving about 15,000 units a month. That includes a mix of fast-moving cables and a smaller volume of adapters. The cables are our main drivers, especially Type-C.

[ASSISTANT 00:53] That’s a good volume. Now, in terms of pricing, are you proposing wholesale margins or a fixed commission per unit?

[USER 01:00] We’d prefer to work on a margin basis, roughly 12% for distributors. That said, we’re open to discussing incentives if certain sales thresholds are crossed.

[ASSISTANT 01:12] Understood. Typically, we operate around 10%, but 12% is workable if the volume is steady. Incentives could help motivate the sales teams. Do you have specific thresholds in mind?

[USER 01:22] Yes, for instance, if monthly sales exceed 20,000 units, we could add a 2% bonus on the incremental sales. It’s a way to encourage scale.

[ASSISTANT 01:34] Makes sense. What about credit terms? Our retailers often prefer some credit period rather than upfront payment.

[USER 01:42] Right, we usually work on a 30-day credit cycle. But for the first shipment, we may request 50% advance, just to establish the relationship. After that, the 30-day terms kick in.

[ASSISTANT 01:55] That’s fair. Logistics-wise, will you be handling warehousing, or should we allocate space?

[USER 02:02] We have a central warehouse near Whitefield. Our plan is to deliver stock weekly to your hub, and from there your network can handle distribution. Does that work?

[ASSISTANT 02:13] Yes, we can manage last-mile delivery from our hub. How about branding support—do you provide promotional material?

[USER 02:21] Absolutely. We have posters, standees, and even digital creatives. Plus, we’re ready to co-fund online ad campaigns with you. Usually, we match up to 50% of ad spend for the first six months.

[ASSISTANT 02:35] That’s helpful. Now, one concern is return policy. Our retailers sometimes face defective pieces or slow-moving stock. What’s your stand?

[USER 02:44] We have a 2% replacement buffer built into every shipment. If there are more defects beyond that, we handle it case by case. For slow-moving items, we offer swaps after 90 days.

[ASSISTANT 02:57] That gives us confidence. Now Rajesh, in terms of timelines, when are you looking to start?

[USER 03:04] Ideally, we’d like to finalize paperwork this month and begin deliveries by the 15th of next month. That way we can capture the festive season sales.

[ASSISTANT 03:15] Perfect. If we sign by the end of this week, we can have things rolling by then. Do you have a draft agreement ready?

[USER 03:23] Yes, our legal team has prepared a draft. I can email it to you by this evening. Could you review and revert by Thursday?

[ASSISTANT 03:31] Sure, send it over. I’ll go through it and share feedback. One last point—do you have GST registration and compliance sorted?

[USER 03:39] Yes, Zenith Imports is fully compliant. GST, TDS, everything is up to date. No issues on that front.

[ASSISTANT 03:46] That’s good to know. In terms of exclusivity, are you planning to appoint multiple distributors in Bangalore?

[USER 03:54] At the moment, we prefer a single distribution partner per metro city. So if we move forward, you’ll be our sole distributor for Bangalore and Mysore.

[ASSISTANT 04:06] That’s excellent. Exclusivity gives us the confidence to invest more aggressively in promotion. Could we include that in the agreement?

[USER 04:15] Definitely, it’ll be part of the draft. Just to clarify, exclusivity is contingent on minimum quarterly volumes. If sales fall below 10,000 units per month for two consecutive months, we may revisit.

[ASSISTANT 04:31] That’s reasonable. From our side, we’ll commit to hitting that volume. Given our existing channels, it’s achievable.

[USER 04:39] Fantastic. Now, regarding payments—do you prefer NEFT, RTGS, or cheque?

[ASSISTANT 04:44] We typically prefer NEFT for speed. RTGS for higher values is fine too. Cheque is slower, but if needed, we can accommodate.

[USER 04:53] Good, NEFT works for us too. We’ll include bank details in the invoice. Lastly, do you have any concerns or additional requirements?

[ASSISTANT 05:02] Just one—training. Our sales reps should be familiar with the product specs. Can you provide training material or sessions?

[USER 05:11] Yes, we can schedule an onboarding session for your team. A one-day workshop at your hub, plus digital manuals.

[ASSISTANT 05:21] Excellent. That should help us push sales more effectively.

[USER 05:26] Great. So to summarize—we’re agreeing on ~12% margin, 30-day credit terms after an initial 50% advance, warehousing by us, distribution by you, 2% replacement buffer, co-funded ads, exclusivity with a volume condition, and start by the 15th of next month.

[ASSISTANT 05:47] Correct. And you’ll send the draft agreement today, I’ll review by Thursday, and we’ll aim to sign by the weekend.

[USER 05:55] Exactly. Once signed, we’ll schedule the first shipment and training session.

[ASSISTANT 06:01] Sounds like a plan. I’ll wait for your email then.

[USER 06:05] Sure. Thanks for your time, Imperial. Looking forward to working together.

[ASSISTANT 06:10] Likewise, Rajesh. Have a good day ahead.

[USER 06:13] You too. Goodbye.

[ASSISTANT 06:15] Goodbye.
